Crop diseases pose a significant threat to food security, but rapid detection remains difficult in many parts of the world due to lack of infrastructure.The naked eye observation is the approach followed by many farmers for the detection and identification of plant diseases. This requires continuous monitoring, which is quite expensive when done with large farms.
Digital image processing and the image analysis technology aids in the automatic detection of plant diseases.

Researchers have put forth various deep learning and machine learning classifier-based models for identifying plant leaf diseases.Although these models produce good results, they still need to be improved in order to develop a more practical leaf disease detection model.Built a hybrid model based on densenet and machine learning classifiers to detect pepper plant leaf disease.
