# Pepper-Plant-Leaf-Disease-Detection-using-DenseNet
Developed a hybrid model which detects and classifies the pepper plant leaf images by applying different data pre-processing techniques and extracting rich features from CNN,Resnet-50 and Densenet.  We observed that Densenet improves the accuracy metrics of ML models better than CNN and Resnet.
